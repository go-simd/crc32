// On every target other than arm64, hasKernel is false: update defers entirely

// AVX-512 fold-by-sixteen) PCLMULQDQ kernel on amd64, and hardware-assisted on
// ppc64le/s390x, so there is nothing to beat there; the hand kernel here targets
// arm64, whose standard-library IEEE path is a latency-bound serial CRC32X.
// foldKernel still exists so update type-checks, and forwards to the portable Go
// fold so that flipping hasKernel on Just Works (used by the dispatch test to
// drive the fold path on these arches). It is a var, not a const, for that reason.
